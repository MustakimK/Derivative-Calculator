# Haskell Derivative Calculator

## Overview
The Derivative Calculator is a Haskell module designed to symbolically compute derivatives of mathematical expressions. It provides an Abstract Syntax Tree (AST) representation for mathematical expressions and supports operations like evaluation, differentiation, and pretty printing of these expressions.
